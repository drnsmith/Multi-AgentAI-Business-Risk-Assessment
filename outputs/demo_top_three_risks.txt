161 Chapter IV  Investing in sustainable energy for all(iii) Project risks
Government stakes in projects are significantly more effective in lowering the cost of debt 
than non-equity forms of government support. Although incentives, subsidies, loans, 
guarantees and price guarantees are important for some critical factors in the investment 
decision, notably initial capital expenditures and project returns, they are less effective 
in improving risk perceptions among lenders. They lower interes

In 2009, South Africa established a renewable energy FIT scheme. Initially, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa developed a 
sector-specific project that ensured rates for 15 years, with tariffs that would decrease annually. To determine the project’s feasibility, public hearings were held with prospective investors, who indicated that the incentives were insufficient, resulting in an increase in the tariffs and a lengthening of the guaranteed period to 20 years. Despite these adjustme

========================
Final Answer:

The top three risks highlighted in the report are:

1. The introduction of temporary solidarity taxes and windfall taxes in various countries like Italy, Portugal, Romania, and the United Kingdom. These taxes apply to companies operating in sectors like energy, oil, gas, and food distribution, and are levied on profits that exceed a certain percentage of the average profits of preceding years.

2. Idiosyncratic project-specific attributes that can influence a project’s company credit risk and capital structure. These risks relate to the different actors involved in the project, the size of the project, and the expected stream of cash flows generated by the project.

3. Policy uncertainty, as exemplified by the case of South Africa's renewable energy FIT scheme. The scheme was never put into effect due to tariff rate uncertainty, bureaucratic delays, and conflicting messages from various government bodies, creating an atmosphere of policy uncertainty.
